h2. Robotlegs utility LazyMediator for better performance in games.

h3. How to use

* Override the *_mediatorMap_* getter method in *_context_* to:

<pre> return _mediatorMap || (_mediatorMap = new LazyMediatorMap(contextView, injector));</pre>

* In the constructor of view classes add:

<pre> new LazyMediatorActivator(this);</pre>

h3. Why it

* *_LazyMediatorMap_* don't listen events of display list and check every added/removed view.

h3. How it works

* *_LazyMediatorActivator_* dispatchs *_LazyMediatorEvent_* when the view is added/removed from stage.
* *_LazyMediatorMap_* listen to the *_LazyMediatorEvent_* from *_contextView_* then check the view.

Current version is compatible with Robotlegs v1.4.0+ because _active field (used in LazyMediatorMap) was removed there.
